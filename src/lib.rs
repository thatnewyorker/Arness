#![doc = r#"
Rustendo library crate.

This crate exposes the emulator core modules for use by binaries and tests.

Modules:
- apu: APU register stub and basic frame IRQ behavior
- bus: Bus facade coordinating CPU/PPU/APU/Controllers and timing
- cartridge: iNES v1 loader and cartridge metadata; constructs a Mapper
- controller: NES controller abstraction
- cpu: 6502 CPU core (modular refactor fa√ßade; preferred)
- cpu6502: Legacy monolithic 6502 core (temporary; slated for removal after refactor)
- mapper: Mapper trait and NROM (mapper 0) implementation
- ppu: PPU register interface, OAM handling, simple timing and NMI latch
- ppu_bus: Trait abstraction for PPU memory reads (decouples PPU from full Bus)

In tests, shared iNES builders are available under `crate::test_utils`.
